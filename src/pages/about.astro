  <h1>About RecallWatch</h1>
  <p>RecallWatch is an independent project that aggregates publicly available recall data and presents it in a clear, searchable format. We aim to help consumers quickly understand what happened, what the risks are, and what to do next.</p>
  <p>Sources include public agencies and open data portals (for example, OpenFDA). We cite official sources on each page and encourage readers to review the original notices.</p>
  <h2>Independence</h2>
  <p>RecallWatch is not affiliated with or endorsed by any government agency or brand. Product names and brand names are used nominatively to reference official recall information.</p>
