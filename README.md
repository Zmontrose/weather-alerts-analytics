# Recalls AI (Zero-cost Programmatic SEO MVP)

This project builds a static site of consumer product recalls from OpenFDA, with programmatic pages for recalls, brands, categories, and states.

## Quick start

1. Install deps
```bash
npm install
```
2. Fetch and normalize data
```bash
npm run data
```
3. Build the site
```bash
npm run build
```
4. Preview locally
```bash
npm run preview
```

Update `astro.config.mjs` site URL before deploying so sitemap/robots are correct.
